Kaiser, the other hospital, said the baby was healthy. 24 hours later, CPS showed up at their house. The police illegally entered their house under force, and ripped the child from the parents arms. CPS cited severe neglect and refuse to comment to the media other than to rely heavily on the information from healthcare provider. However, if they did, then they should have paid attention to Kaiser saying the child was safe. There wasn't an emergency situation, so without a warrant, so and the police violated the family's rights.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.news10.net/news/article/242734/2/Couple-fights-to-get-baby-back-from-CPS-police","issues":[{"id":"4","name":"Civil Rights and Liberties"},{"id":"10","name":"Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement"},{"id":"21","name":"Family"}],"signatureThreshold":100000,"signatureCount":732,"signaturesNeeded":99268,"url":"https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/release-information-regarding-kidnapping-sammy-nikolayev-cps-and-help-them-fight-rights-violation/9jQkVN6s","deadline":1369806989,"status":"open","response":null,"created":1367214989},{"id":"517d3073b15a7a9c2900000e","type":"petition","title":"PROVIDE EVERY ADOPTED PERSON A COPY OF THEIR ORIGINAL BIRTH CERTIFICAte AND UNDUE 75 YEARS OF ANCESTRICIDE!","body":"For the past 75 years, 7,000,000 ADOPTED ADULTS' LIVES HAVE BEEN KEEP LOCKED UP IN VITAL STAT OFFICES ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY, CAUSING A MALADY KNOWN AS ANCESTRICIDE AFFECTING THE ADOPTEE, THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN. \r\nIt is time for our Federal Government to stand up and take responsibility for allowing federal agencies in HRS to continue this inhumane practice.
